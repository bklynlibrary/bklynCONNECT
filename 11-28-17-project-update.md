Hi all,

I'm emailing you today to give an update on the BklynConnect digital access and equity project, which you all have been involved in at some point, in some capacity. Apologies if this is repeat information for some of you, but I'd like to start sending regular updates. 
- Brownsville
- Osborn Plaza
- DiscoTech January 13th and 20th
