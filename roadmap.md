# Project Mission and Summary
BklynConnect is a community-driven wireless internet implementation in Osborn Plaza (in Brownsville, Brooklyn, NY) and intergenerational technology stewardship program with digital literacy training for volunteers. The goal is to prototype in one neighborhood what broad internet access and community-driven digital literacy education could look like. If successful, the project could be replicated across all of the 59 Brooklyn Public Library branches across Brooklyn, or can influence how organizations like BPL design and offer internet access and digital literacy education.
