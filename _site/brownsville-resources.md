# Resources in Brownsville: people, knowledge, space

In order to organize a DiscoTech, we'll need the collaboration of lots of people and organizations in Brownsville. 
- **Space**: where is a place, within our budget, that can hold 20-30 people for the planning day of the DiscoTech on January 13th, and 100 for the public event on January 20th? We will need outlets and wifi. Ideally, they have tables, and are central, easy to get to, and of course wheelchair accessible
- **DJ**: Who is a great DJ from Brownsville that we want to support? A DiscoTech would be a misnomer if we didn't have music.
- **Food**: Should the event be catered? Could/should it be a potluck? How many people should we expect to feed?
- **Station Managers**: DiscoTechs are all about prioritizing the participation of people who have been traditionally excluded and/or attacked by technology. A station is similar to a table at a science fair — each station focuses on a unique drop-in activity. Who can share their knowledge and experiences with technology in an interesting way?
- **Greeters**: Greeters are the people who welcome participants, help them navigate the DiscoTech, and solicit donations or surveys
- **Host/MC**: This is someone who encourages people to explore and keeps people updated on movie screening times or raffle status (if we choose to do anything like this).
