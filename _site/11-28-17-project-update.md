Hi all,

I'm emailing you today to give an update on the BklynConnect digital access and equity project, which you all have been involved in at some point, in some capacity. Apologies if this is repeat information for some of you, but I'd like to start sending regular updates. Please do let me know if you would prefer to not be included in future updates. 

In collaboration with TYTHE, we've published Digital Equity needs assessments for three neighborhoods: Brownsville, Bedford Stuyvesant, and East New York. These are public, so please read and use them.

After meeting with a couple of different organizations, we've decided to pilot this program in Brownsville, with a wireless internet implementation in Osborn Plaza, and some sort of digital literacy training for fellows/stewards. We'll be collaborating with the Mayor's Office of Technology and Innovation's NYCxCoLabs, and are seeking other partners.

In order to pilot community ownership of technology, and an intergenerational digital literacy fellowship, we'll be hosting a pair of events on January 13th and 20th. In other contexts, this type of event has been called a DiscoTech, short for Discovering Technology. [You can read more about the DiscoTech model here](). On January 13th, we'll bring together 20-30 people from our target group who might benefit from participating in a fellowship. 

Feel free to send the following blurb: "" 


- Brownsville
- Osborn Plaza
- DiscoTech January 13th and 20th
- Open questions, largely budget dependent: stipends? an interactive kiosk?
